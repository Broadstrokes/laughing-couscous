            <p>
                As a new patient, our dentists will evaluate your oral system to comprehensively 
              determine what treatment options are recommended. This involves evaluating each tooth, 
              checking for any signs of gum disease, biting problems, and also an oral cancer screening 
              exam. Our office also provides digital x-rays instead of the traditional film system. 
              Advantages of this include an almost instantaneous image of the area captured displayed 
              on a monitor. This allows chairside explanation with the patient to determine what’s going on.
              Digital x-rays also provide a more detailed resolution than films, making earlier detection 
              and treatment of problems a reality. Most importantly, digital x-rays decreases radiation 
              exposure to you.

            <p>
                The foundation and surrounding structures of our teeth is known as the periodontium.
              Many factors can cause the periodontium to become diseased and inflamed. If left untreated, 
              this could cause receding gums, tooth loss, and subsequent drifting of other teeth which 
              can change the appearance of your smile. We provide individualized specific treatment options 
              for each of our patients to help maintain a healthy periodontium.

            <hr className="hr-services"></hr>
            <p>
                Composite Restorations – These are also known as white fillings. At our office, we are 
              proud to provide bonded composite resin restorations as opposed to the traditional silver 
              amalgams. These can be used to repair decayed and chipped teeth to help you restore your 
              smile and bite. In today's day and age, the colours now match very well with the vast 
              majority of people's teeth, such that even you may not notice that there's a filling there 
              after we finish!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> As with all fillings, any decay or compromised tooth structure must first be 
              removed by a dentist to ensure that the filling material lies on sound tooth structure. 
              Then, the tooth is dried and prepared for the bonding agent to do its job to ready the tooth 
              for the filling material. A bright blue light is then used to activate the bonding agent 
              before the filling is placed. Then, our dentists will shape the filling to its correct 
              anatomical form and then polish it so that it's hard for people to discern that you've had 
              dental work done!

            <hr className="hr-services"></hr>
            <p>
                An excellent option for many patients to replace a missing or soon-to-be-missing tooth. 
              These are made of a biocompatible titanium alloy in the shape of a little screw that is 
              placed into the bone to replace the roots of a tooth. After a period of healing time, the 
              implant is then exposed, and an impression is taken of the structures around it. 
              A laboratory then fabricates an implant-supported crown based on the shape of your teeth 
              to restore esthetics and function.

            <hr className="hr-services"></hr>
            <p>
                When a tooth is compromised such that a filling may not be the best option for the 
              longevity of the tooth, a crown is a full coverage restoration that’ll protect the 
              tooth more completely. These can be made from a variety of materials, such as all-ceramic, 
              porcelain-fused-to-metal, or a gold alloy. This procedure requires 2 or more appointments 
              spread out over a week or two, as a dental laboratory technician is needed to fabricate 
              a crown custom made for your teeth. In the meantime, we will provide you with a temporary 
              crown to help you protect the remaining tooth structure and to provide a “test-run” for 
              what the final shape and bite of the tooth feels like.

                A fixed, as opposed to removable (such as dentures), option to replace a missing tooth 
              or teeth. This consists of 3 or more fused crowns extending from one anchor tooth to 
              the other, with artificial teeth attached in the middle. Similar to crowns, these will 
              usually require 2 appointments to complete.

              Candidate teeth include those that are slightly chipped, show superficial crack lines, 
              or are discolored internally for a variety of reasons. Made of an all-ceramic material, 
              these are bonded to your teeth similar to white fillings to ensure longevity. Similar to 
              crowns, these usually require 2 appointments. In the transition waiting time while a dental 
              laboratory makes the porcelain veneer, a temporary veneer will be fabricated for you to 
              protect the tooth and your smile.

            <p>
                Trauma to a tooth, either through blunt force or dental decay, can irritate the nerve of a tooth. 
              If this irritation leads to bacteria entering the nerve, or pulp, of a tooth, the pulp often can’t 
              heal itself and becomes infected. This infected pulp can cause pain and swelling that does not go 
              away by itself. If this is the situation, a root canal therapy is indicated to remove the infected 
              pulp to get rid of the symptom. Contrary to popular belief, root canals help relieve one from pain, 
              not cause additional pain. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> To keep you comfortable, we first anesthesize the area. Then, we need to access the 
              pulp chamber through the tooth in order to clean and shape the canals of the pulp, which is where 
              the bacteria lie. After that, sometimes it’s best to leave some medication in the canal space to help 
              disinfect the tooth even more, and at the next appointment, to fill the now clean canals with a 
              natural inert tree rubber called gutta percha. Then, we have to restore the tooth, usually with a 
              full coverage restoration such as a crown, or in some cases, a direct bonded composite restoration.

              Our team will determine the diagnosis and prognosis of a tooth and whether or not a specialist 
              is needed to remove the tooth. If so, we will communicate with the specialist and forward all 
              x-rays and instructions to them. If a specialist is not required, one of our team members can 
              take out the tooth for you. Then, if recommended, treatment options will be presented to you 
              to determine the options to replace the missing tooth.
